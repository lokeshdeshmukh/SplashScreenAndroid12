Android 12 adds the SplashScreen API, which enables a new app launch animation for all apps. This includes an into-app motion at launch, a splash screen showing your app icon, and a transition to your app itself.

The new experience brings standard design elements to every app launch, but itâ€™s also customizable so your app can maintain its unique branding.
